Development:
 - Finish Fast3D support in `gbi.h`:
   - [X] `G_MW_FORCEMTX` and related macros.
   - [X] Fix `g{,s}SPMatrix`.
   - [X] Fix `g{,s}SPVertex`.
   - [X] Fix `g{,s}SPViewport`.
   - [X] Fix `g{,s}MoveWd`.
   - [X] Add `g{,s}SPInsertMatrix` (low priority).
   - [X] Check `g{,s}SPModifyVertex`.
   - [X] Check whether the `__gsSP1{Triangle,Line3D}_w1` have any use for us,
         since the 2Triangles and Quadrangle stuff doesn't seem to be defined
         in Fast3D. Make sure that they aren't used in gz.
   - [X] Fix `g{,s}SPCullDisplayList`.
   - [X] Fix the `g{,s}SPBranch` macros, and `gSPLoadUCode` related macros.
         They aren't defined in Fast3D, so we should make sure that they aren't
         used in gz.
   - [X] Fix `g{,s}SPNumLights`.
   - [X] Fix `gSPLight`.
   - [X] Fix `g{,s}SPLookAt{X,Y}`.
   - [X] Fix `g{,s}SPopMatrix{,N}`. The N variant doesn't exist in Fast3D, so make
         sure it isn't used in gz.
   - [X] ~~Fix `g{,s}SPGeometryMode`~~. Check whether gsSPLoadGeometryMode has an equivalent in F3D.
   - [X] Fix `g{,s}SPSetOtherMode`.
 - [ ] Read RAM entry point from the ROM itself instead of hard-coding it in the Python script.
 - [X] Check the address at which `SM64_gDisplayListHead` points before and after the
       `gfx_flush()` call to make sure that the DL is inserted.
 - [ ] ~~Research the behaviour of the RDP for invalid DLs.~~
       There isn't much in the official docs. Maybe try to inject a known DL with
       deliberately wrong data and see what happens. Choose a second level DL
       to mess with a single layer (or try to).
